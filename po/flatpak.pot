#. - This action is checked to see if the installation should be allowed
#. based on whether the app being installed has content which doesn’t
#. comply with the user’s parental controls policy (the content is
#. ‘too extreme’).
#. - It is checked only if an app has too extreme content for the user
#. who is trying to install it (in which case, the app is ‘unsafe’).
#. - Typically, normal users will need admin permission to install apps
#. with extreme content; admins will be able to install it without
#. additional checks.
#. - In order to configure the policy so that admins can install safe and
#. unsafe software anywhere without authorisation, and non-admins can
#. install safe software in their user or system dirs without
#. authorisation, but need authorisation to install unsafe software
#. anywhere:
#. * Unconditionally return `yes` from `app-install`.
#. * Return `auth_admin` from `override-parental-controls` for users
#. not in `@privileged_group@`, and `yes` for users in it.
#. * Set the malcontent `is-{user,system}-installation-allowed`
#. properties of all non-admins’ parental controls policies to true.
#. - In order to configure the policy so that admins can install safe and
#. unsafe software anywhere without authorisation, and non-admins can
#. install safe software in their user dir without authorisation, but
#. need authorisation to install safe software in the system dir or to
#. install unsafe software anywhere:
#. * Unconditionally return `yes` from `app-install`.
#. * Return `auth_admin` from `override-parental-controls` for users
#. not in `@privileged_group@`, and `yes` for users in it.
#. * Set the malcontent `is-user-installation-allowed` property of all
#. non-admins’ parental controls policies to true.
#. * Set the malcontent `is-system-installation-allowed` property of
#. all non-admins’ parental controls policies to false.
#. - In order to configure the policy so that all users (including
#. admins) can install safe software anywhere without authorisation,
#. but need authorisation to install unsafe software anywhere (i.e.
#. applying parental controls to admins too):
#. * Unconditionally return `yes` from `app-install`.
#. * Unconditionally return `auth_admin` from `override-parental-controls`.
#. * Set the malcontent `is-user-installation-allowed` property of all
#. users’ parental controls policies to true.
#. * Set the malcontent `is-system-installation-allowed` property of
#. all users’ parental controls policies to true.
